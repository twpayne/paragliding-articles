Speed bar, when to use
======================

> I very rarely use my speed bar and i am slowly using it more and more. Just to clarify on the use between lift, are you saying that you use it to achieve best glide between the points or just get there as quick as possible?

Both - they're usually (but not always) the same. 

This is speed to fly. Briefly, with more speed bar you go faster but your glide gets much worse so you arrive at the next thermal lower. Sometimes, however, the thermals are so strong that even though you arrive lower at the next thermal, you arrive much earlier so that by the time your non-speed bar using friend has arrived, you've already climbed higher than him! Paul McReady did all the math to work out just how much speed bar you should use to get to base at the next cloud as quickly as possible: if the thermals are strong then it's best to use lots of speedbar, arrive low and have lots of time to climb to base. If the thermals are weak then it's better to fly slower - close to best glide, which is normally at trim speed - and so arrive higher but later, closer to base. There's also a special case when you want to reach a point on the ground as quickly as possible (e.g. crossing a goal line) - do you leave the thermal early and glide well but slowly, or do you climb higher and then glider faster but less well? 

This all depends on how your glider performs, and is critically important for sailplanes and hang gliders that glide like demons. For us paragliders, it turns out that as soon as you expect the next thermal to be 3m/s or better, then it's best to arrive early and low, i.e. glide on full bar. 

On a good XC day in the Alps, when you know that there will be a thermal waiting for you (e.g. crossing Lake Annecy, heading for the Roc des Boeufs) then, as you get the hang of it, you'll find that a lot of your time is spent gliding and twiddling your thumbs. Flying faster - using more speed bar - reduces the amount of time that you spend waiting between thermals. This is why I personally switched from a DHV 2 to a 2-3 a few years ago: it was because I was getting bored on glide. As your flying career progresses, this will happen to you (but be sure to enjoy the journey that gets you there!). 

So how much bar to use? 
- If you're on a EN A then only use speed bar to escape sinking air. 
- On an EN B, you should use the first 1/4 of the bar as much as you use the first half of the brake range, i.e. some brake in thermals. a little speed bar between thermals. 
- By the time you're flying an EN C, you should be gliding on half bar all the time unless you're in lift or have a tail wind. 
- EN D and Competition pilots consider the speed bar as just part of the glider controls, to be used all the time, just like 3rd and 4th gear in your car. 

And to be clear: you don't *need* to use your speed bar. If you're flying in good conditions and are not too bothered about flying long distances then it simply doesn't matter. At the same time, it is the key to unlocking the other half of your glider's performance. Learn to use your speed bar in normal, good conditions and unlock this potential: you'll learn to master your glider, fly further and faster, and have a spare margin of speed and performance ready in case you ever need it.
