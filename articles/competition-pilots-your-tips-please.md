Competition pilots: your tips please!
-------------------------------------

Good topic! There's already been a lot of advice published on the web, for example:

There was also a very good article about getting into comp flying in Cross Country magazine a couple of years back, I'll dig out the reference when I get home.

Here are some of the things that I've learned from other people in my two years of comp flying:

From Mark Hayman and Adrian Thomas: The race only really starts 15-20km from goal. Up to this point the lead gaggle is working as a team - spreading out to find lift on glide, searching for better cores, and letting searchers back into the thermal if they don't find anything. They're still flying fast, but it's as a group, not as individuals. As soon as someone is confident that they'll get to goal on their own they break from the pack and it's a dog-eat-dog race to the line. As Adrian said elsewhere recently, you want to be top of the gaggle in the final climb before goal.

From Russ Ogden: Work on your climbing skills. People like Russ and Mads are amazing climbers: they always seem to climb to the top of the stack and stay there. The golden rule here is never be satisfied with the lift that you're in. If you see someone climbing faster than you then full speedbar to their core immediately. If you do even one turn just to see if they are really doing better then they'll overtake you. The decision should be automatic and instantaneous. And I'm really serious about using full speedbar to move between cores in thermals.

Personally I always have in mind a minimum acceptable climb rate which depends on what I've experienced so far that day, what I expect and how low (desperate) I am. As a rough rule this should be no less than 1m/s less than the strongest climb you have experienced so far that day, unless you're really low. Then, immediately reject (fly straight through) any lift weaker than that. If you find a good core then leave it as soon as it drops below your threshold, don't mill around hoping for it to get stronger. One of the traits that you see in the very top pilots is that they are very selective about their climbs: as soon it starts to weaken they leave. Mark Hayman tells a funny story from the PWC in Italy last year. He's thermalling in the lead gaggle in a decent climb but Chrigel Maurer is out ahead, has bagged the turnpoint, and is flying back towards the gaggle. "Oh, cool,", thinks Mark, "I'll get to see how the world's best pilot thermals." Chrigel flys straight at the gaggle and then straight through it without even bothering to turn! Chrigel then dives into the lee of the mountain (where no-one else dares to fly), connects with some screamer and disappears into oribit. "Oh, that'll be why he's number 1," grumbles Mark.

It's hard to over-emphasise how important confidence is when it comes to fast decision making. Confidence that you can climb as well as anyone else so if someone else can stay up then so can you. Confidence that you'll find lift on glide or at your next thermal trigger. Confidence allows you to make a decision and act upon it with total commitment, with an assumption of success. Less experienced pilots take every climb as high as they can then fly at best glide and try to hedge their bets by flying over as many thermal triggers as possible. This floating about the sky is the way to start your XC flying career but it is not the way to win competiions.

Confidence comes from experience, practice and good equipment. Experience of XC flying gives you the ability to make the right decision, to identify your next climb so you fly in the right direction. Practice means that you keep your skills sharp. One of the best things you can do is fly on weak days and try to get to and stay at the top of the stack. If you can reliably do this then you'll know that you'll be able climb out if a decision ever goes wrong. Equipment means having a glider that you can thermal well and that you trust so you can fly it at 100% of its potential. Practice pulling asymmetrics, frontals, spiral dives, wingovers, SATs, helis, full stalls, spins everything when you get the chance. Trusting yourself on your glider means that you can fully commit to your decisions.

Flying fast has little to do with flying on full bar on every transition. Speed is in your decision making, and importantly in not making mistakes. As pilots improve the average speed that they can fly at around a course without bombing out goes up. An average XC pilot manages about 20km/h average (in zero wind) and a good XC pilot might do 25km/h. PWC gaggles do about 35km/h and the top pilots average over 38km/h.

So, here are some games to play to help your speed:
- on weak days, get to and stay at the top of the stack
- in thermals monitor other pilots and full bar to any pilot climbing faster than you
- decide where your next climb will be and fly straight to it without turning
- practise turning your wing inside out in the air
- try the two methods of gliding described in Kelly's blog above to find out which works best for you

Strangely enough, last night I was thinking about writing an article for PGforum entitled "mistakes I made last year in competitions", of which there were several. This post, however, is already plenty long enough so I'll save it for another time.
