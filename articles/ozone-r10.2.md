The Ozone R10.2
===============

My R10.2 finally arrived just before the British Open in Slovenia. Here are my initial impressions: 

Size: S (90-100kg) 
My all-up weight: approx 93kg 
Harness: Gin Genie Race with fairing 

I've got about 20 hours on it now, mostly in thermic and slightly windy conditions in the British Open in Slovenia. I've spent quite a lot of time on unofficial full bar (when the rings touch the pulleys) but have not used the trimmers much. 

### The Good 

- The whole wing is beautifully made. There's attention to detail everywhere. 
- Performance is simply mind-blowing. It feels like a sailplane. There seems to be no penalty for using the bar. Compared to Mark Watts who was at the top end of the weight range on his Boomerang 7, I have noticeably better glide at all speeds, especially high speed (75%+ bar). He has more top speed, almost certainly due to his higher wing loading, but his glide then really suffers. The R10.2 is also much more stable when accelerated. 
- Bar pressure is very light, helped no doubt by the big fat ball bearing pulleys on the risers. 
- Handling is very nice (but see caveat below). You don't feel like you're flying a wing with a 7.6:1 aspect ratio. 
- It is particularly efficient relative to other wings in bumpy conditions, both in thermals and on glide. I'm still getting the hang of piloting with the B-risers but it's obvious how effective it will be once you've mastered it. 
- Top speed is fantastic, probably 65km/h-ish for me lightly loaded on the small, I'm sure the fat boys go faster. 
- It looks beautiful in the air. 

### The OK

- It has a reputation as being a bit of a beast to launch, especially in strong winds, but I've found it OK. It certainly requires a bit more care than your average LTF 2-3 / EN D brick but it's not hard. 
- There are round toggles on the B risers for piloting using the Bs while on bar. I can only just reach them with my short arms. 
- The wing feels quite fragile with it's ultralight materials, but glider longevity is really controlled by how well you care for it and (in a comp wing) how long it takes to be superseded by next year's model, so I don't think this is a problem. 
- I've had three blow-outs on full bar in turbulent conditions, all about 60% of the leading edge. Two were surprisingly non-eventful, one was a bit interesting: I got swung around quite a lot but the glider didn't turn much. It definitely needs a careful touch when it goes wrong. In smooth air you can fly full speed (ring to pulley) hands-off taking photos no problem. 

### The Bad 

All the following are already known by R10.2 pilots. 
- It's hard to make it go down quickly. I haven't managed to get stable big ears yet, you can't B-line it, and the manual says don't spiral beyond -8m/s. This makes you think twice before flying near big clouds! 
- Sometimes when thermalling I've found that the inside wing gets lifted and it's hard to get it to turn into the core. This can sometimes be quite worrying if you're thermalling close to terrain and the wing refuses to turn! 
- It takes ages to pack it up to avoid damaging the rigifoils (which together cover about 80% of the chord) and it doesn't pack short. 

### The future 

I've only got a few hours on the wing, as I get more I'll surely find fixes for most of my complaints. Particularly, I need to fly with more weight, learn to use the trimmers properly, and get the hang of B-riser flying. 

### Summary 

I've only a small inkling of the technology that Ozone have put into this wing, but there is no doubt: it is absolutely amazing. Compared to a conventional paraglider, flying an R10.2 is a different sport. I reckon that it'll add 25% to my cross country distances compared to the Mercury and if you're flying one you have no excuse for not beating every other wing in a competition. It's a stunning achievement by Ozone, the R10.2 is certainly the first of a new breed of paraglider. I love it.
