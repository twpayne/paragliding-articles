WHAT SORT OF PILOT ARE YOU?
===========================

Take our 10 step quiz to find out!

1. It's mid-week and raining. How do you spend your evenings?

   a. Eagerly reading every post on the internet forums.

   b. Checking the latest detailed weather forecast.

   c. Watching telly with the Missus.

2. There's a frontal system forecast to pass through sometime during the weekend. Flying conditions will be poor while it crosses the country, but if it clears though in time, then it could be epic. The only trouble is: you're supposed to be going to your girlfriend's brother's birthday picnic. What do you tell your girlfriend?

   a. Warn her that the conditions might be good and you might go flying, and keep a close eye on the weather.

   b. Nothing. You're girlfriend already knows that if it's possibly flyable then you won't be there.

   c. Explain to your girlfriend about how you sacrificing a great day's flying but make no plans to actually go flying because it's still rather uncertain and it'll probably be better weather another time.

3. You're on the hill in the morning, but the wind's too light to soar and it's too early for the thermals to have started. What do you do?

   a. Lob off anyway for a top-to-bottom and a walk up: every second of airtime and every take-off and landing counts.

   b. Unpack your glider and ground handle so you can be ready to go as soon as the conditions are `on'.

   c. Wait. Conditions will get better.

4. You're flying, just staying up, and a thermal comes through and you find yourself climbing nicely. What do you tell your friends on the radio?

   a. Hey guys! You gotta launch! It's great up here! I can see over the back and everything!

   b. This is pilot P. I'm over the quarry and my climb rate is 2m/s average. Wind is speed 15km/h from the north west. Downwind looks good.

   c. Hey mate, can you call my wife and tell her that the car's broken down again?

5. The wind has picked up and those who were marginally staying up are now soaring comfortably away from the hill or climbing out. However, it feels a bit strong on take-off.

   a. No worries, you practice ground handling well back from the edge.

   b. Who cares? You're already flying and looking for that thermal up to base.

   c. Sit it out and wait for conditions to calm down. Remark on the recklessness of the pilots flying to your friends.

6. You've found your first thermal up to base and are looking back to take-off. In fact, you've drifted with the thermal quite a bit, it's now quite weak and it looks like it'll be marginal whether you'll make it back to take-off without a walk. What do you do?

   a. Amazing! The view is incredible! This is what you've dreamed about!

   b. Assess the sky downwind. If there's an obvious cloud or trigger then glide for it, otherwise stay circling in zeros in the thermal you're in until a better option presents itself.

   c. Humpf. Apply full speedbar and head back to take-off. Hitching back to launch is a real hassle and only worthwhile if you're going to break the site record.

7. You're on glide for a good looking cloud with a slight tailwind. It has a well defined top and a flat bottom. How fast do you fly?

   a. Min sink. You know that this will maximise your glide over the ground and that you'll arrive as high as possible.

   b. Speed to fly. You estimate the strength of the lift under the cloud and slow down or speed up as appropriate. You know that this will get you to the top of the next thermal as fast as possible.

   c. Full bar. It's only worth flying XC if the day's classic and if it's classic then the speed to fly is full bar. If you don't make the thermal then you'll have more time to hitch back to your car.

8. In the distance ahead you see what might be a runway, but you're not sure if there's any airspace around it. What do you do?

   a. Land. You don't want to risk an incident.

   b. Unfold your airmap, check your GPS, call your friends on the radio, anything to get a clear answer on what the associated airspace is. If you get a clear answer then you adjust your flight plan to avoid it, otherwise you land.

   c. This never happens. You know all the airspace within a 100 mile radius in all directions.

9. It's the end of the day and conditions are weakening. You're at cloudbase under what feels like it'll be the last climb of the day. What do you do?

   a. Circle with the dying cloud for as long as possible, enjoying the view.

   b. Circle with the lift for as long as possible, then head off downwind at best glide over the ground to maximise your distance.

   c. Look for the nearest train station or friend's house and spiral down to land next to it.

10. How was it for you?

   a. Best flight ever! Gotta fly again! Whaddya doing tomorrow?

   b. Good. Average climb rates 2m/s. Wind 15km/h NW. Weak inversion at 1500m. Distance covered 60km at average speed 20km/h.

   c. It was better this time last year.
