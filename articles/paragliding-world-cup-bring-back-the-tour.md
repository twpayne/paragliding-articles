Paragliding World Cup: bring back the tour
==========================================

This document explains why I personally would like to see the Paragliding World Cup return to the Tour format for 2011 and beyond. It's a criticism of the Superfinal and Continental Tour format run in 2009 and 2010 and explains why I think a return to the Tour format as used in 2008 is better for the pilots, the World Cup and the sport as a whole. This is based on my own impressions and analysis of the World Cup over the last two years and many discussions with competition pilots, organisers and staff, both in the PWCA and in other organisations. However, all the views expressed here are purely my own and explicitly do NOT represent those of the British Paragliding Competitions Panel.

The terminology I use is:
PWCA: The Paragliding World Cup Association, the group of people who run World Cup events
Tour format: World Cup format in 2008 and earlier, five rounds where every round counts equally towards the final World Cup result
Superfinal format: World Cup format as used in 2009 and 2010
Continental Tours: the "sub tours" of the Superfinal format

What's wrong with the Superfinal?
---------------------------------

Superficially, the Superfinal seems like an excellent idea: the ultimate paragliding competition where the best pilots of the moment from each continent race against the greatest pilots in history to determine the best paraglider pilot on the planet. Theoretically it's open to all: a good pilot with limited time - a family, a job - can qualify in just one week and take the title in just two more. The crown of World Cup Champion is no longer limited to the select few pilots who by grace of sponsorship, private wealth or sleeping in their car can attend all rounds. Politics are cast aside, it's the purest competition organised by pilots for pilots.

Although grandiose in concept, the Superfinal is not the claimed panacea. Here's why.

### Time commitment

Nominally, under the Superfinal Format, you can win the World Cup in just three weeks: one to qualify, two for the Superfinal. This is presented as making the Superfinal more accessible to non-professional pilots. However, the reality is that anyone hoping to qualify in a single week is taking a big risk. In the last few years competitions have been affected by rain, wind, storms, tyre fires, volcanic ash, airline strikes, airspace restrictions, and even bomb scares. Individual pilots have been affected by gear problems, illness, family or work issues, or simply an "off" week. If you're serious, reserving two weeks to qualify is a minimum. Add it all up and the four weeks total of the Superfinal format is not so different to the five weeks total of the Tour format.

### Looking backwards

The Superfinal gives automatic entry to previous World Cup and World Championship winners. Yes, these guys and girls are legends in their own time, but who would you choose to represent the sport of paragliding? Someone who was exceptionally good compared to their peer group fifteen years ago but whose priorities now lie elsewhere, or an up-and-coming pilot eager to make his/her mark on the world stage? Looking at the actual results in 2009 and 2010, very few Legends have been coaxed out of retirement, and when they've taken part they've generally done well but not brilliantly. The Legends system dwells on the past. Paragliding should focus on the future.

### One shot

The winner of the Tour format has proved him or herself able to perform in five different corners of the World in five different sets of conditions. This is a real achievement: there are few pilots who can blast in to goal in booming thermals as well as change down two gears and win in weak conditions. The Superfinal demonstrates just one site, one type of flying. If it suits you, great, but does it really determine who is best pilot on the planet?

What about magic glider effect? At a single event, whichever pilot has the best glider at the event has a huge advantage. A Tour, run over the course of a year, gives other pilots and other manufacturers a chance to catch up and levels the playing field. Glider development still happens, probably faster because the magic glider is not simply revealed at the last possible moment.

A single event depends on single factors: a single site, a single style of conditions, a single glider. With so many specifics, is it really a fair to declare an overall winner?

### Confusion with the FAI World Championships

The FAI World Championships is a two week event to determine the best individual paraglider pilot. The Paragliding World Cup Superfinal is a two week event to determine the best individual paraglider pilot. What's the difference? There are understandable political differences between the pilots' association of the PWCA and the more established bodies of the FAI. Yes, the FAI selects the best pilots in its member countries whereas the PWCA selects the best individual pilots, but for all active paragliding nations these are the same people. Is it really right to declare two different Champions when the only difference is the political body that organised the competition? Previously the "league" nature of the World Cup Tour format clearly distinguished it from the one event nature of the World Championships but with the Superfinal there is no clear distinction.

### Low status of non-superfinal events

If the Superfinal is the ultimate paragliding event, what does that make the other World Cup rounds? They're no longer on the Formula 1 Grand Prix circuit with equal value and all the best pilots. They're mere secondary qualification events. How do you attract pilots to the second event of the season when you know that one third have no need to go because they qualified in the first event and another third are planning to go to the next event and have no need or interest to attend yours?

Under the Tour format winning an individual event was recognised as a stunning achievement. Under the Superfinal format, with their lower pilot quality, winning an individual event is respected but not as much.

### World Cup qualification is a solved problem

Under the Tour system pilots qualified for the World Cup by achieving excellent results in FAI Category 2 competitions. These Cat 2s served as both National Championships and World Cup qualification events. A pilot with limited time could, in the same week, stand on the podium at his National Championship and assure his place in the World Cup the following year. Under the Superfinal format, he merely qualifies for the opportunity to qualify for the Superfinal. Is there a real advantage to including this extra layer of qualification?

### A high risk strategy

If you're a pilot hoping to qualify for the Superfinal in just one week then you just have to hope that that week works out. All your eggs are in one basket. If you're at the Superfinal then the pressure to run tasks is enormous. When presenting the Superfinal format to pilots at the end of 2008 the PWCA answered the question "What about bad weather at the Superfinal?" with the simplistic response "No bad weather!". Mother Nature has taken a different view. There will be epic competitions and there will be weeks where the weather is bad. What the Superfinal format means is that every competition depends on the weather - either as a qualification event for the few pilots who chose that event as their sole qualification event, or as a Superfinal where the eyes of the World are watching.

Add to this the fact that the majority of competition pilots live in Europe and therefore the Superfinal should occur in Europe if it wants the best pilots to attend. Except that it also has to occur after all the other events, i.e. at the end of the season in Europe. At the end of the season, few locations are good, and it's a risky strategy to hope that the weather will be kind.

### A crowded calendar

In 2010 the World Cup will run nine weeks of competition: seven qualification events and one two-week Superfinal. There's not enough changeover time to run competitions in adjacent weeks: you have to allow a day for the pilots and organisation to travel. As a result, between mid May and mid August 2010 there was not a single week which was not either adjacent to a World Cup event nor conflicted directly with one. The World Cup is still well respected as a competition series, but a number of nations had no choice but to run their national competitions in conflict with a World Cup event. Both sides lose: either the best pilots cannot attend the World Cup due to their national events, or the national events lose their best pilots to the World Cup.

The proliferation of events also takes its toll on the PWCA staff. With a competition every other week for three months they are continually travelling, rarely at home for more than a few days at a time.

### Continental tours are a joke

One of the objectives of the PWCA in their introduction of the new format was to encourage the development of paragliding outside Europe, manifest in the Asian and American Continental Tours. The reality is that these tours are a farce. There were only two events in Asia and two events in the Americas in 2010, the first attracted a grand total of six pilots, the second attracted ten. Even in Europe, only sixteen pilots took part in all contributory rounds. Average attendance was less than ten percent. This clearly demonstrates that under the Superfinal format pilots only care about the Superfinal, and everything else is irrelevant.

### Local politics become global problems

There are fundamental differences between the PWCA and the FAI/CIVL. The PWCA sees itself as an association of pilots, organising competitions for pilots, and free from international politics. CIVL works extremely hard to provide excellent guidance and infrastructure, but is hindered in some geographical regions by local politics. Specially, there are a few countries where the local National Aero Club - the FAI-sanctioned body officially responsible for paragliding - is quite separate from the association representing the majority of active pilots in the country. Notable examples are Turkey, Brazil and Japan. Unfortunately, by siding with the active pilot organisations in these countries the PWCA merely reinforces the tensions between the different interests.

Paragliding is a minority sport and is only harmed by divided interests. Instead of prolonging these differences, the PWCA should work with CIVL to bring fair representation to paraglider pilots wherever it is currently missing.

### The Asian problem

I am under the impression that a few people have influenced the PWCA to serve their own well-intentioned interests. I have not been able to determine the truth or otherwise of this, but speculation abounds as to why the two Asian rounds of the World Cup in 2010 conflicted with the FAI European Championships, thus preventing the participation of the vast majority of top European pilots. I understand that there is a strong desire by one of the World Cup's key sponsors promote paragliding in Asia and the PWCA attempted to meet this desire by running two Asian events. The situation was further complicated by the NAC/pilots' association tensions mentioned above. However, what happened was that the World Cup events were under-subscribed and a mere six Asian pilots took part in both events. The PWCA - which claims to be an apolitical organisation - in fact acted politically and suffered heavily because of it.

### The FAI is winning

If you want to find out who are the top 100 pilots in the World at the moment, the reality is that you don't look at the World Cup results, you look at CIVL's World Pilot Ranking System (WPRS). The World Cup events are part of this (when they are FAI sanctioned, which was not the case for all events in 2010 due to local politics), but although the World Cup events are included and very high scoring, they are simply one of many. Fundamentally, the World Cup is no longer seen as the ultimate testing ground for the best pilots in the World, it is merely a series of competitions not too dissimilar from any other.

### Confused priorities

Good competitions occur when there is a clear focus and a shared goal, be it learning and fun or finding a National Champion. What are the priorities of a World Cup event? Win the individual event? Accumulate WPRS points? Qualify for the Superfinal? Score points for the Continental Tour? Take part in a World Cup event and henceforth be able to claim that you're a "World Cup pilot?" By being pulled in so many directions, it is no wonder that the World Cup seems to have lost its direction and focus.

### Last-minute selection

In 2010 the World Cup *started* selection for events two months before. The fall-out was horrendous and, to my knowledge, not a single World Cup event in 2010 has been full. The reasons are many:
- some pilots need more than two months notice to get time off
- last-minute airline tickets and hotel bookings are expensive
- once you've qualified for the Superfinal, there's no incentive to go to other qualification events
The PWCA secretary worked extremely hard to get pilots to each event. You need to give pilots a reasonable amount of time to organise their trip. If they can eventually take their place then great, but if they are unable to take it then you need to offer the place to the next pilot. Except the next pilot now has even less time to organise their trip and will pay more for their plane tickets and hotels, so they're less likely to be able to come. The net result is that you end up with a cascading failure of pilots able to come and at the end it is only those with flexible jobs and money to spare who can attend. This is the exact situation that the Superfinal format with its nominally reduced time commitments was supposed to avoid.

### The WPRS matters

CIVL's WPRS is increasingly used by different Nations both as the basis for funding elite-level pilots and for national team selection. Consequently, top level pilots care deeply about their WPRS ranking and are only interested in high-scoring competitions. Historically FAI Category 1 and World Cup events have had the highest pilot quality. However with the falling pilot quality of World Cup events outside the Superfinal, these events become less interesting for top pilots, further reducing the pilot quality and causing a downward spiral.

Related to this, the Superfinal is a two-week event that provides only one result for the WPRS, whereas two one-week Tour rounds provide two results for the WPRS.

### Sponsorship difficulties for pilots

Put yourself in the position of a talented pilot looking for sponsorship to be able to take part in the World Cup. Under the Tour format you can tell a potential sponsor: "I'll race against the best pilots in the world across five different locations, it's the Formula 1 of paragliding". What do you say with the Superfinal format? "There are seven qualification events, of which I'll probably do two or three and at which only a few of the good pilots will be there. If I qualify then I'll go to a one-off event in a distant country that's a bit like the FAI World Championships but isn't the real World Championships." As a sponsor, which format is the most interesting?

### Media and sponsorship difficulties for organisers

The World Cup is an expensive series of competitions to run. The pilot entry fee for each event is fixed by the PWCA and the PWCA take a large fraction of this. Another large part of the entry fee goes on cash prizes for the winners - required under the PWCA rules. To simply break even pilot entry fees are not sufficient, the organisers have to find many sponsors, which is hard work. This the primary reason that there are few World Cup events in established competition destinations.

Sponsors and media interest go hand in hand. So, how do you sell your event?
you: "The Paragliding World Cup is coming to our area, it's a fantastic spectacle, would you like to be part of it?"
media: "Great! Is the current Champion going to be there?"
you "Er, not sure, he's already qualified for the Superfinal because he won last year."
media: "Uh, OK, so it's just a qualification event? But our National Champion will be there, right?"
you: "Um, probably not, he already qualified by finishing in the top 15 at the last event."
media: "Who was that guy who dominated the sport back in the nineties? What about him?"
you: "He gets automatic entry to the Superfinal, so he doesn't need to come."
media: "What about the new up-and-coming pilot from Italy that we've heard so much about?"
you: "Unfortunately he can't make it because the competition conflicts with his National Championships."
media: "But most of the top pilots will be there, right?"
you: "Well, we'll get a few but half of them are doing a different qualification event in Portugal in two weeks time and hope to qualify there instead."
media: "So why should I care about this event?"
you: "..."
media: "Don't call us, we'll call you."

Competitions with empty places and are a financial disaster, leaving the local organisers (typically the well-meaning local clubs) with debts and losses that might take years to pay off.

### Quantity not quality

Under the Tour system the World Cup would visit the best destinations at the best time of year. However, with seven non-Superfinal events to be found in 2010, the World Cup has had to visit good locations at the wrong time. Normally all World Cup venues are tested with a Pre-PWC, a check-out competition on the local site and the local organisation. However, in 2010 the World Cup visited at least one destination where there were no tasks flown at the corresponding Pre-PWC. Surprise surprise, the World Cup had the same bad weather as the Pre-PWC and the organisation was poor. All three European destinations in 2010 were new destinations, the well-known and reliable destinations are much less interested in hosting a World Cup under the Superfinal format.

Of course, there are excellent flying destinations to be discovered, but unknown destinations always carry a risk. Typically this risk is borne by a couple of adventurous FAI Cat 2s, but under the Superfinal format we see the World Cup itself taking these risks, and when it doesn't work it's the pilots who suffer.


So who benefits from the Superfinal format?
-------------------------------------------

So, apart from one or two key individuals in the PWCA, who actually prefers the Superfinal format? We see that its main proponents are pilots who argue that the Superfinal format makes the World Cup more "open to the average pilot", that it gives "all pilots an equal opportunity to compete in the highest level of competition." Of course they are right - everybody and their dog can get a place. But a competition which is open to the average pilot is by definition no longer the highest level of competition. There are many more average pilots that great ones, but in the eyes of the PWCA all pilots voices carry equal weight. Will the World Cup be dragged down and drowned in the mediocrity of the masses? When you pick your national team, do you want it to be open to all, irrespective of skill, or do you want the best?


The reality of the new World Cup format: empty places, low pilot quality and a diluted brand
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Despite huge waiting lists at the start of the year - evidence of a lingering respect for the World Cup - not a single event has been full. Whereas once you needed a top ten finish in your National Championships to earn a place at a World Cup event, you can now get in with a mid-level finish in an average Cat 2. As long as you are able to get time off work at the last minute and are rich enough to pay for the last-minute airline tickets you can go. Pilot quality is low, there are more and more intermediate wings flown by intermediate pilots being drafted in at the last minute to a desperate attempt to make up the numbers. Destinations are untested and all to often second-rate. Whereas once you had to earn your place at a World Cup with fantastic results, now all that is required is an average wing and a healthy bank account. Whereas once the phrase "PWC Pilot" would earn you respect, now it's just another Cat 2 competition. What a shame - the World Cup has been and should be so much more.


The World Cup is more than just another competition
---------------------------------------------------

Motor racing has Formula 1. Football has the FIFA World Cup. The Paragliding World Cup should be the pinnacle of OUR sport, the ultimate level that all pilots should aspire to. The World Cup should be the best that we - paragliding as a whole - can achieve. The best destinations. The best organisation. The best pilots. It should inspire every pilot to discover what is possible on paraglider, and it should demonstrate to the public that paragliding is simply amazing. Yes, to achieve this you have to be selective with your destinations, your organisers and your pilots. The role that the World Cup plays is much more than just another competition, it is the World Cup's responsibility to show the world just how good we can be.


A proposal
==========

So this was a really negative post. I really do think that the Superfinal format is a disaster for the World Cup, the organisers, and the pilots. But as well as pointing out problems you should also propose solutions, right? Here they are.

1. Return to the Tour format. Three or four events, five maximum. Assume that a pilot has five weeks holiday, give him four weeks for the World Cup and one for his National Championships. Fewer events means more selectivity: pilots will do their utmost to get a place, and the World Cup will be able to pick and chose the best destinations.
2. Select pilots early so they can plan their calendars. Cat 2s can do a great job as qualification events, and having World Cup qualification letters to offer as a prize boosts Cat 2s, their pilots and their organisers. Select the year before - everyone should know if they have a place by 1 January.
3. Work with the FAI/CIVL, where differences between the NACs and Pilot Associations exist, encourage reconciliation.


A vision
========

This was proposed to me, but I think it is a fantastic idea.

The World Cup reclaims its place as the ultimate individual competition, a true Formula 1 for paragliding, with the top individuals in the WPRS.
The FAI World Championships become a pure team event, maybe on certified wings.


Thanks
