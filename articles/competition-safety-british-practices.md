Competition safety: British practices
=====================================

The British Championships take safety extremely seriously. We have developed several systems to ensure that the flying environment is as safe as possible and that in the event of an incident we can get help to the pilot as quickly as possible. These safety procedures do not replace the individual pilot's responsibility for his/her own safety.


Registration
------------

### Insurance details

At Registration we record the insurance details of every single pilot, including the insurance company, policy number and 24-hour emergency assistance number. This means that in the event of an incident these can be immediately communicated to the emergency services.


Task setting
------------

### Task Committee

The task is set each day by the Task Committee. This is made up of two or three experienced pilots who are very familiar with the flying area and one pilot representative elected by the pilots at the first briefing. Their goal is to set a safe, fair, and fun task using the maximum potential of the day for the pilots competing. This includes being sensitive to issues such as pilots on lower rated gliders and pilot fatigue levels.

### Safety Committee

The Safety Committee consists of the Comps Panel Safety Officer and one pilot representative elected by the pilots at the first briefing. The Safety Committee's job is to ensure that the task is safe for all pilots. If you have concerns about the task set on any day then communicate these to the Pilot Representative who will represent this to the Task Committee.

### Timing

The Task Committee also set a number of key times:
- Window Open and Window Close: when you are allowed to launch
- Race Start: when the race starts
- Goal Close: when the race ends
- Report In Time: the latest that you can report back that you are safe
These times are critical for safety, especially Goal Close and Report In Time, and are explained below.

### Task briefing

All information relevant to the task and safety is presented clearly on a large board during the task briefing. This includes safety frequencies and telephone contact numbers for the organisation. The briefing includes a complete weather forecast for the flying area.


Launch
------

### Sign to fly

We require that each pilot who choses to fly sign his/her name on a sheet at launch. This is so that we know who to check for at the end of the day. Sometimes pilots miss a day due to being unfit to fly or have to leave the competition early. The sign to fly procedure also ensures that we do not misappropriate the rescue resources looking for them. It is important to note that if you do not sign to fly then you score zero for the task, as your inaction directly undermines one of our simplest and yet most important tracking systems.

### Window Open

You are allowed to take off between the Window Open and Window Close times. Window Open is typically thirty to sixty minutes before Race Start and Window Close is typically one hour after Race Start. The window will only open if the Meet Director deems the conditions to be safe to launch. If conditions degenerate then the Meet Director may temporarily or permanently close the window. The task is only valid if there has been sufficient opportunity for all pilots to launch safely.

### Meet Director on the ground

The Meet Director remains on the ground at all times and does not fly himself. This means that he is on launch and able to open or close the window according to conditions on launch. During the task his full attention is on the safety of the task and he can quickly travel to wherever he is most needed.


In the air
----------

### Safety frequency

All pilots are required to tune their radios to the same frequency. This allows the Meet Director to communicate critical safety information to pilots and for all to communicate in the case of an accident.

### Turn direction

For each day we set a turn direction that must be observed by all pilots while thermalling before the start. This is an area which has defined parameters and where all pilots contained must observe and adhere to the nominated turn direction for the task. Normally it alternates left and right on alternate days, but exceptionally may be overridden for safety reasons - for example to ensure that pilots are turning away from the ridge. This information is clearly posted on the task board and is communicated to all pilots at the task briefing. Pilots who do not obey the turn direction may be penalised. Once the race starts the turn direction for each thermal is chosen by the first pilot turning in that thermal.

### 3-Level system

In the air the Task and Safety Committee are in constant radio contact with the Meet Director giving regular updates on the conditions along the course line. They communicate their objective assessment of conditions using a three level system:
- Level 1: Good, racing conditions, continue.
- Level 2: Some cause for concern, continue but be alert.
- Level 3: Too strong, or becoming too strong, task should be stopped.
Using this information, the Meet Director makes the final decision as to whether to stop the task or not.

### Stopping the task

If the Meet Director decides that conditions are no longer safe he will take the immediate decision to stop the task. The difference between a stopped task and a cancelled task is that a stopped task is still scored whereas a cancelled task is not scored. For example, if conditions become unsuitable before the Start Time then the task is cancelled: no-one has scored yet. If the conditions become unsuitable much later in the day then it is stopped. When task is stopped you should immediately pull big ears providing it is safe to do so. This is a visual signal communication to pilots whose radios may be malfunctioning that the task has been stopped. You should then and then land as safely and as quickly as possible.


Landing
-------

### SMS check-in

You are required to SMS your GPS coordinates to the retrieve coordinator within 30 minutes of landing. If you are in goal then there will likely by a marshall collecting pilot numbers. This allows the competition organisation to record that you are on the ground and safe. You will receive a text in response confirming the receipt of your text. If you do not receive this within five minutes then check your mobile phone coverage and re-send your text. If there are any safety problems then include the word HELP or MAYDAY in your text and it will immediately be flagged on the Retreive Coordinator's screen.

### Goal Close and Land-By Time

Goal Close is when then race ends. If you are still flying at Goal Close time then your final position for scoring is your position at Goal Close time. You can continue flying, of course, but any extra distance you fly will not score. Land-By Time is the time by which you must be on the ground and have reported in your position to Retrieve. If you have not reported in by the Land-By Time then the Race Organisation will phone you to check to see if you are OK. If you do not reply then this will signal the launch of a search and rescue operation.

### Land-By Time

Land-By Time is typically set early enough that a search and rescue operation can be launched in daylight, and may be set earlier if conditions are expected to deteriorate during the day.


### HQ check-in

When you have got back to HQ you are required present yourself in person at the Compeition HQ to complete the final check-in procedure as well as to download you GPS.

Example incidents
-----------------

Here we demonstrate how the safety systems work in two cases, firstly a reserve deployment and secondly a stopped task.


### Reserve deployment

Racing conditions are good with good thermals and high cloudbases. A pilot takes a collapse while thermalling at altitude near turnpoint 2:

At about four o'clock Jim takes collapse and has difficultly regaining control of his wing.  Five seconds later, when Jim is still not in control:
*Mark on Safety Frequency:* "This is pilot 12. Someone is in difficulty at turnpoint 2."
*Meet Director:* "OK, keep me informed."
*Mark:* "Pilot is on a red a white wing with a cocoon harness."
A few seconds later, Jim throws his reserve.
*Mark:* "Reserve out. Clean deployment. Repeat: reserve out, clean deployment. Over."
*Meet Director:* "OK, I have the pilot in sight."
*Mark:* "Can confirm that pilot is on a red a white wing. Reserve OK. GPS coordinates are approximately 46.345 N 3.123 W. Over."
*Meet Director:* "Thank you pilot 12, please standby."
Jim floats down under his reserve and lands in a small cluster of trees.
*Mark:* "Pilot landed under reserve in trees approximately 2km south of turnpoint 2."
*Jim:* "This is Jim, I threw my reserve and landed in the trees. I'm uninjured but will need a bit of help getting out."
*Meet Director:* "We're already on a way to your location. Are you able to give me your exact coordinates?"
*Jim:* "Yeah, hang on... OK, they're 46.305 N 3.120 W."
*Meet Director:* "Confirm your coordinates are 46.305 N 3.120 W."
*Jim:* "Yeah, that's it."
*Mark:* "This is pilot 12. I'm landing to assist."
*Jim:* "No need mate, I'm alright. Keep going."
*Mark:* "You sure?"
*Meet Director:* "We'll be there in ten minutes."
*Jim:* "Yeah, keep going mate."
*Mark:* "OK, will do. Beers on me tonight Jim, I wanna hear all about it!"


### Task stopped

Thermal conditions are good, but there's a chance of large Congestus development later in the afternoon. The Task Committee have set a short, fast task with an early Land-By Time. Every five to ten minutes since Window Open the committee have been reporting level one (good conditions) but about half way round the task things change:
*Richard, on private Committee Frequency:* "Level 2. It's developing faster than forecast. There is significant cloud development in the mountains to the north. It's OK where we are but our area might be next."
*Meet Director:* "Copy level 2, Richard."
*John, on private Committee Frequency:* "Yeah, it's looking pretty big to the north. Level 2."
*Meet Director:* "Copy level 2, John. Keep me informed."
A few minutes later:
*Alex, on Pilot Safety Frequency:* "This is pilot 31. I'm worried about the clouds! Level 2!"
*Meet Director, on Committee Frequency:* "I'm getting 2s from the pilots. Committee, please give me your assessments when you can, please."
*Richard:* "This is Richard at turnpoint two. It's OK at the moment in my area, but I'm monitoring the clouds to the north. Level 2."
*John:* "I'm at turnpoint three. I've flown this area a lot, it normally pops off in the North first, but it often dies down. Level 2, but keep an eye on it."
Fifteen minutes later:
*John:* "OK, the cloud north of turnpoint 4 is growing significantly. Conditions are OK on the course right now but I reckon it'll go boom soon. Level 3."
*Richard:* "I agree, level 3."
*Meet Director:* "OK, I've got two level 3s. I'm stopping the task."
*Meet Director, on Pilot Safety Frequency:* "Task stopped. Repeat: task stopped. All pilots, please land."
All pilots put in big ears before they begin their descent to land safely.
On landing pilots immediately begin texting they have landed and are safe.


More safety features
--------------------

In Slovenia we made a number of improvements:

- we had a mountain rescue team standing by, who were on their way to pilots in difficulties within a couple of minutes of a pilot being reported in difficulty
- we opened the window after the briefing as soon as it was clear that pilots could easily stay up, this significantly reduced the stress levels on launch (no more crowding waiting for window to open) because pilots could take off over the period of 30-45 minutes and still get to the start on time. No stress = happy, safe pilots.
- we used exit cylinders for starts away from the ridge that reduced crowding and gave everybody the opportunity for a fair start
There is no doubt that we'll be applying these successes to our future competitions.
