+1 Chris.

Here are a few challenges that I think are good milestones that could be incorporated into a post-AP syllabus. I give each one a rating between one and ten, where three is CP level, four is what I think Pilot level should be, five is what I think AP level should be, and ten is Russ Ogden level. A plus sign indicates that this challenge requires skills beyond just flying. The following list is obviously biased by the aspects of flying that I know, feel free to expand it...

Here goes:

 * (4) fly a 30km XC in the UK
 * (4) fly a 30km closed-circuit XC in the Alps
 * (4) demonstrate smooth, linked wing overs up to 45 degrees of bank
 * (4) demonstrate a spiral dive with a smooth, controlled exit up to -10m/s
 * (4) attend a pilotage course
 * (4+) hike-and-fly more than 3,000 feet in a day
 * (4+) demonstrate correct interpretation of weather forecasts to identify good flying days three days ahead
 * (4) take part in a Cat 2 competition
 * (4) demonstrate full exploitation of a glider's polar curve, including sustained low and high speeds

 * (5) fly a 50km XC in the UK
 * (5) fly a 30km XC in the UK to a declared goal
 * (5) fly a 20km out-and-return in ridge lift in the UK
 * (5) fly a 100km XC in the Alps
 * (5) demonstrate smooth, linked wing overs up to 90 degrees of bank
 * (5) demonstrate a spiral dive with a smooth, controlled exit up to -20m/s
 * (5) demonstrate both left- and right- handed SATs
 * (5) demonstrate dynamic full stalls
 * (5+) hike-and-fly more than 6,000 feet in a day
 * (5+) hike-and-fly from three mountain take offs that you don't know, without a guide
 * (5+) demonstrate correct interpretation of a sounding to predict thermal strength, wind at different altitudes, cloud base, cloud cover and precipitation
 * (5) write and publish an article in a national magazine
 * (5) give a talk at your local club

 * (6) fly a 100km open-distance XC in the UK
 * (6) fly a 100km closed-circuit XC in the Alps
 * (6) fly 150km in the Alps
 * (6) demonstrate advanced piloting techniques, including controlled 90-degree spins from min-sink, rear-riser piloting, and active piloting with the speed bar
 * (6) fly 5km upwind against a wind of 15km/h (10mph) or greater
 * (6) fly 10km without turning on a course of +/- 45 degrees in the UK
 * (6) fly 20km without turning on a course of +/- 15 degrees in the Alps
 * (6+) hike-and-fly from a 4000m+ summit
 * (6) SAT-to-heli or Misty Flip
 * (6) place in the top half of a sizable Cat 2 competition
 * (6) lead at least three pilots on a 30km XC
 * (6) fly a tandem, safely

 * (7) 150km in the UK
 * (7) 200km in the Alps
 * (7) McTwist or rhythmic SAT
 * (7+) complete a "111" (111km vol-biv or vol-visa in 1+1+1=3 days)
 * (7) finish in the top 10 in one task in a mid-level competition
 * (7) finish in the top quarter overall of a mid-level compeittion
 * (7) lead at least three pilots on a 50km XC

 * (8) place on the podium of a Cat 2 competition
 * (8+) complete a "222" (222km vol-biv or vol-visa in 2+2+2=6 days)
 * (8) finish in the top ten in one task at a high-level (PWC or Cat 1) competition
 * (8) tumbling
 * (8+) adventure fly with a take off above 6000m
 * (8+) improve a glider's handling and/or performance by trimming the line lengths
 * (8) take part in a top-level competition (PWC, Cat 1)

 * (9) break a national or continental record
 * (9) fly somewhere that nobody has ever flown before - somewhere that makes other pilots dream
 * (9) top land on a very, very high mountain and take off again

 * (10) win a Cat 2 competition by a comfortable margin
 * (10+) have a regular column in your national magazine
 * (10) infinity tumbling
 * (10) place in the top 50 of the WPRS
 * (10+) adventure fly above 7000m
 * (10) break a world record
 * (10+) design a paraglider and fly it

There's lots to learn...
