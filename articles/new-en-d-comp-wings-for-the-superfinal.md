New EN D comp wings for the Superfinal Colombia 2012?
=====================================================

> Do we have to expect new EN D Comp Wings for the Superfinal Colombia 2012?

I think it is very likely that we will see one or two new EN D Comp Wings at the next Superfinal, and that 2013 will be a repeat of 2012 in terms of pilots buying new wings or not having access to competitive wings. Reasons: 

1. The Superfinal is at the start of the year, and I'm sure some manufacturers will want to send their best possible wing. 
2. These wings will still have to be certified, which is expensive, so they will only certify a single size (M). 
3. The CIVL Plenary will be in February, after the Superfinal, and the uncertainty of what CIVL decides will discourage manufacturers from spending time and money certifying other sizes. 
4. The CIVL Plenary will almost certainly say in February "manufacturers have already invested money in EN D Comp Wings for the 2013 season so it's too late to change anything now" and so conclude "EN D only in 2013, new Comp Class (maybe) in 2014". 
5. With new wings due to come in 2014, there will be even less incentive to certify non-M size wings. 

As a result, at the start of the season - just like this year - the most competitive wings will only be available in very limited sizes, with the other sizes following either very late or never. 

The extent to which this happens will of course depend on what new EN D Comp Wings we see. Currently pilots are selling their EnZos to buy Icepeak 6s, so I would be very surprised if Ozone did not bring out a EN D Comp Wing with a shark nose to compete on ease of use with the IP6. Top pilots are fleeing Gin to fly either EnZos or Icepeak 6s; Gin will need to bring out something with more performance than the Boomerang X if they wish to be taken seriously at the top level. 

I don't expect we'll see new EN D Comp Wings from manufacturers other than from those who are already working on them (Ozone, Niviuk, Gin, and maybe Axis and 777). To make a wing with as much performance as the EnZo or the Icepeak 6 takes a lot of work. Previously manufacturers could just copy an existing competition wing to give their team pilots. Although these copies were clearly not as good as the original wing, they were at least vaguely competitive. Now, with the added costs of certification, the barrier to entry is just too high. 

Finally, if new EN D Comp Wings are being created, the process won't be very visible. You can't test competition wings in competition any more - they have to be certified first. This means that competitions are now not very interesting to designers and test pilots as they can't simply turn up with a prototype and tune it during the competition. So, we'll see fewer test pilots and designers at competition, and we won't get an early look at their new creations.
