Safety arguments: A spotter's guide
===================================

Safety arguments are a popular topic for internet forums, but following the hundreds of passionate posts each day can be intimidating. This quick guide will help you categorize posters so you quickly pigeon-hole them according to whether they agree or disagree with your point of view. You can then gently stroke your ego by re-reading in detail the posts that you already agree with, while quickly dismissing those who challenge you with a quick flick of the negative karma button. Long posts are hard and require difficult considering, so don't read them in detail. Instead, scan, judge quickly, and click those karma buttons, baby, yes!



The Hot Shot
-------------

This young spunker is a damn good pilot. He's motivated, skilled, and gets good results. He's out flying all time, addicted to paragliding and doesn't really understand what's so hard about flying a 2-liner full speed through a partial leeside.

*Good points:* Has huge amounts of direct, first-hand experience
*Bad points:* Assumes that all other pilots are as skilled and as gung-ho as he is
*Motto:* Freedom to choose!



The Wanna-Help
---------------

The Wanna-Help really, really genuinely wants to help. He knows that safety is not easy, but there must be something simple that everybody else ever so far in history, ever, has overlooked. Surely a couple of changes, here and there, will render paragliding, if not safe, at least significantly safer?

*Good points:* Genuinely cares, occasionally comes up with a good, albeit unworkable, idea
*Bad points:* Nineteen times out of twenty, independently comes up with the same ideas that have already been worked through and shown to be either ineffective, unworkable, or utterly misguided
*Motto:* Are you saying that it's impossible to improve safety?

Professor Stats
---------------

Blind to emotional sensitivity, Professor Stats believes that only truth is mathematics. For him, pilots are lab rats to be observed and experimented upon in his application of the scientific method in the pursuit of ultimate performance and safety.

*Good points:* Genuinely tries to be objective
*Bad points:* Assumes (incorrectly) that everyone else is as rational as he is
*Motto:* Your inability to understand is not my problem

The Data Fabricator
-------------------

He considers himself a rational Professor Stats, but where as the Professor tries to work with real data, the Data Fabricator is not afraid to pick numbers out of his bottom to prove his case when he can't find them elsewhere.

*Good points:* Tries to be scientific
*Bad points:* Completely fails
*Motto:* Let's assume that the per-hour accident rate of the average pilot is X...

Mr You're-Dangerous-I'm-Safe
----------------------------

Mr You're-Dangerous-I'm-Safe knows what's right: it's what he does. Glider classes below the level he flies are for beginners. More demanding gliders are death ships. He's done a few comps. Not many, and he didn't do particularly well, but that in no way diminishes his expertise in the subject.

*Good points:* May subconsciously realise that different gliders are appropriate for different people
*Bad points:* This knowledge tends to remain subconscious
*Motto:* The correct class to fly is...

The Grunt
---------

Once, years ago, he was given advice by a friend who was better than him at the time, and now this advice is - angels on trumpets please! - The Gospel Truth. Hallelujah! His beliefs are carved in stone and no amount of careful reasoning, threats of violence, or divine intervention will ever change them.

The Grunt's favourite game is Team Echo Chamber. Sergeant Billy-Bob smuggles an ill-informed opinion grenade into one thread, and while brave heroically throw themselves upon it to try to limit its damage, Lieutentant Thornton lobs a similar ignorance scatter bomb into a different topic. Within minutes, the two counter-reactions feed off each other explode in shower of confusion and circular references.

*Good points:* With careful grooming, The Grunt can be used as cannon fodder in the war of attrition against the opposition
*Bad points:* Has poor aim, often takes out allies in the crossfire
*Motto:* If repetition doesn't work, you're not using it enough

Tried It. Scared myself. Not my fault.
--------------------------------------

He did well, and he's got a trophy to prove it. Boy, did he mash that bar and teach everybody else in the class above a lesson or two. So, he moved up a level to play in the next league. He assumed that his previous winning flying style would carry him to glory. Then, within a few flights, he had a scary incident - from which, luckily, he escaped mostly unscathed. Clearly, given his previous success, the only possible explanation for his incident is that hotter gliders are horrendously dangerous.

*Good points:* Has some real experience with the class above
*Bad points:* Has very limited experience with the class above, is mentally incapable of taking any personal responsibility
*Motto:* Level X+1 wings will try to kill you

The Family Man
--------------

He's played the game, he was probably a Hot Shot once. But now, now that's he's successfully reproduced, he's controlled by his DNA. What really matters to him now is the mini-me and the hapless female most likely to be persuaded into squeezing out another sprog or two. The closest he gets to flying is scraping baby poop out of the camper van that he drove in that one perfect summer where he flew ten comps.

*Good points:* Has many wise insights
*Bad points:* Not quite ready to leave the scene yet and so attempts to redefine paragliding to be one that is compatible with him spending time lots of time with his kids
*Motto:* What's really important?

Mr Opinion and Mrs Hearsay
--------------------------

Mr Opinion doesn't really know anything, but boy does he have a strong opinion and boy is it his right to express it! If challenged, he will reply that the fact that his Mum's school friend once told him that saw a glider on TV means that he is as much affected by competition safety as anyone else, and so his voice should be heard. His close partner is Mrs Hearsay, ever the gossip and always keen to claim that she heard that someone else said that...

*Good points:* Reminds everyone that paragliding does not exist in a vacuum
*Bad points:* Everything else
*Motto:* I have a right to be heard!

The Conspiracy Theorist
-----------------------

The Conspiracy Theorist is utterly convinced that there's a conspiracy hide the truth, whatever his truth is. Maybe it's unreported accidents that, if they ever surfaced, would prove his paranoia. Maybe it's that the governing body is run by an evil cabal of old glider pilots intent on destroying his sport.

*Good points:* Searches endlessly for incriminating evidence
*Bad points:* Never finds what he is looking for
*Motto:* The truth is being concealed!

Voice of Experience
-------------------

He's been flying at the highest level for years. Maybe he's now a test pilot, designer, or respected old hand. Whatever the history, he genuinely understands the game of whack-a-mole that is safety, both the good and the bad.

*Good points:* Genuinely knows what he's talking about
*Bad points:* Long since tired of arguing with idiots, tends not to post
*Motto:* The fundamental issue is....

The Political Animal
--------------------

He joined the governing body for the free ski holidays he could tack onto the end of the annual meetings in the Swiss Alps. He hasn't flown anything for years and now has difficulty telling the difference between an competition glider and a retrieve bus. Now these bloody pilots are obliging to actually have to do some bloody work! Quickest thing to do is probably to ban everything to divert attention while he gets back to working his way up the organisation ladder and towards that National Aero Club Golden Achievement Badge.

*Good points:* Wields immense power
*Bad points:* Uses it to promote own interests
*Motto:* You idiots can't be trusted to look after yourselves.

There you go, I hope I've offended everybody at least once (including myself). Now you can just tell your forum opponent: you're being an X. Much more efficient than actual debate!
